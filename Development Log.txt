[06/10/2016] Jordan:

> Removed the excessive breaks (<br>) and replaced them with a div on the header and footer
> Tidied up the CSS so it's easier to read
> Repositioned "col-3" into the center since it was stuck to the left. 
		- Had to remove an unecessary div above the "col-3" then aligned in inside the index.

[07/10/2016] Jordan:

> Added some hover kits that I made into the folder "hover_css_kits"
		- This allows people to crop the section of CSS they want without going into the main CSS removing anything accidently

> Added a new button "UI Button 2" with a new animation - the seperate css is put into the hover_css_kits
> Started creating a drop down menu within the "about" section - haven't added any CSS though.
		- Looks untidy but will work on it later

[10/10/2016] Jordan:

> Changed default button animation to something more simple, smooth and elegant
> Changed inverse button animation
> Changed basic button
> Changed UI Button
		- Removed UI Button 2

> Changed color format to red for the website as decided with Jake.
> Added a smooth dropdown animation to "About" on the top navbar.
		- Slight bug where it won't let you hover over home, news, etc and always reverts to opening the "About" dropdown.

[11/10/2016] Jordan:

> Changed the font to "Jura" as an experimental touch
> Added 4 new buttons for basic UI navigation as requested by Jake
		- Placed the new animations for the buttons on each

> Renamed "hover_css_kits" to "j-kit_css"
		- Internal folder called "buttons" where each individual button has it's CSS seperately placed in those files so people can easily grab it.
		- Under the subfolder "buttons" there is categorised folders corresponding within the grouping of buttons inside index.html.

> Added a line break with "<hr>" styling under the class "<hr class="line_seperator">" 
		- Can add this in anywhere within the index.html for seperating the buttons.

> Categorised the buttons inside index.html
> Still need to fix the top nav about sub menu
> Fixed the colouring of the top and bottom navbars. Had to seperate li a and jkit-nav-default with their own selectors.
> Added hover animations on the top and bottom navbars
> Added the submenu when you hover over "About" - the submenu position isn't correct but I'll fix that when I come back to it tomorrow.

[13/10/2016] Jordan:

> Made the dropdown animatin on about smoother (Very minor change)
		- Aligned the dropdown menu (Finally!) 

[14/10/16] Jake:

> Updated Spacing of Whitespace Footer
> Updated Colour's of Buttons and gave them names.
> Started work on panels, Sky and Positive nearly done.
> Added Disabled option for buttons, but need to actually make it disable.
