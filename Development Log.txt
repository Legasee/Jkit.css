[06/10/2016] Jordan:

> Removed the excessive breaks (<br>) and replaced them with a div on the header and footer
> Tidied up the CSS so it's easier to read
> Repositioned "col-3" into the center since it was stuck to the left. 
		- Had to remove an unecessary div above the "col-3" then aligned in inside the index.

[07/10/2016] Jordan:

> Added some hover kits that I made into the folder "hover_css_kits"
		- This allows people to crop the section of CSS they want without going into the main CSS removing anything accidently
> Added a new button "UI Button 2" with a new animation - the seperate css is put into the hover_css_kits
> Started creating a drop down menu within the "about" section - haven't added any CSS though.
		- Looks untidy but will work on it later
